  Obviously, there's a DATA FRAME which contains the data you're trying to plot. Then the
| AESTHETIC MAPPINGS determine how data are mapped to color, size, etc. The GEOMS (geometric
| objects) are what you see in the plot (points, lines, shapes) and FACETS are the panels used in
| conditional plots. You've used these or seen them used in the first ggplot2 (qplot) lesson.

 There are 3 more. STATS are statistical transformations such as binning, quantiles, and
| smoothing which ggplot2 applies to the data. SCALES show what coding an aesthetic map uses (for
| example, male = red, female = blue). Finally, the plots are depicted on a COORDINATE SYSTEM.
| When you use qplot these were taken care of for you.
